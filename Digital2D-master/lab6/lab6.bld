WARNING:ConstraintSystem:119 - Constraint <NET "A_P59" LOC = P59;>
   [lab6.ucf(3)]: This constraint cannot be distributed from the design objects
   matching 'NET "A_P59"' because those design objects do not contain or drive
   any instances of the correct type.

WARNING:ConstraintSystem - A target design object for the Locate constraint
   '<NET "A_P59" LOC = P59;> [lab6.ucf(3)]' could not be found and so the Locate
   constraint will be removed.

   matching 'NET "B_P61"' because those design objects do not contain or drive
   any instances of the correct type.

WARNING:ConstraintSystem - A target design object for the Locate constraint
